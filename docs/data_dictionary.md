## Derived Variables

The following variables are derived from the primary economic indicators:

### Lag Variables

Lag variables capture the delayed effects of economic indicators on recession onset.

| Variable Pattern | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| {indicator}_lag{n} | Value of the indicator n months ago | GDP_lag3 = GDP value 3 months ago |

### Rate of Change Variables

Rate of change variables capture the trends in economic indicators.

| Variable Pattern | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| {indicator}_pct_change_1m | 1-month percentage change in the indicator | GDP_pct_change_1m = (GDP - GDP_lag1) / GDP_lag1 |
| {indicator}_pct_change_3m | 3-month percentage change in the indicator | GDP_pct_change_3m = (GDP - GDP_lag3) / GDP_lag3 |
| {indicator}_pct_change_12m | 12-month percentage change in the indicator | GDP_pct_change_12m = (GDP - GDP_lag12) / GDP_lag12 |

## Processed Datasets

The following processed datasets are created during the analysis:

| Dataset | Description | Location |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| merged_data.csv | Combined dataset with all economic indicators | data/processed/merged_data.csv |
| data_with_features.csv | Dataset with lag variables and rate of change features | data/processed/data_with_features.csv |
| data_normalized.csv | Normalized dataset with standardized features | data/processed/data_normalized.csv |
| data_pca.csv | Dataset with principal components | data/processed/data_pca.csv |

## Notes on Data Frequency

- Economic indicators have different natural frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- All data is standardized to monthly frequency for analysis
- For indicators with higher frequency (daily, weekly), the last value of the month is used
- For indicators with lower frequency (quarterly), the value is repeated for each month in the quarter

## Data Coverage and Cutoff

**Data Period**: January 1970 to May 2024
**Data Cutoff Date**: May 2024

All data collection is limited to May 2024 to ensure consistency across all indicators and provide a clear temporal boundary for the analysis. This timeframe encompasses 8 recession periods and multiple economic cycles, providing sufficient historical data for robust model training.
