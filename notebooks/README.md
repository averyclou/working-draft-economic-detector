# Economic Downturn Detector Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing economic indicators and developing a recession prediction model using Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA).

## Notebook Structure

The notebooks follow a logical progression:

1. **01_data_exploration.ipynb**: Explores the economic indicators data and their relationships with recession periods
2. **02_feature_engineering.ipynb**: Creates lag variables and other features to capture leading indicators
3. **03_multiple_discriminant_analysis.ipynb**: Applies MDA to identify the most significant predictors of recessions
4. **04_combined_data_analysis.ipynb**: Analyzes the combined dataset with consumer sentiment data
5. **05_feature_engineering_optimization.ipynb**: Optimizes feature engineering with advanced techniques

## DRY Structure

The notebooks have been optimized to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by leveraging the `econ_downturn` package. This is achieved through:

1. **notebook_utils.py**: A utility module that provides common imports, configurations, and helper functions
2. **econ_downturn package**: The main package that contains all the core functionality

## How to Use

1. Start by running the notebooks in order (01 â†’ 05)
2. Each notebook builds on the previous ones, so it's important to follow the sequence
3. Use the `notebook_utils.py` module for common functionality
4. For custom analysis, import specific functions from the `econ_downturn` package

## Utility Functions

The `notebook_utils.py` module provides several utility functions:

- `setup_notebook()`: Sets up the notebook environment with common configurations
- `load_data(use_cached=True)`: Loads all data sources and merges them
- `display_data_info(data)`: Displays information about the dataset
- `save_figure(fig, filename, output_dir=None)`: Saves a figure to the output directory

## Example Usage

```python
# Import notebook utilities
from notebook_utils import (
    setup_notebook, load_data, display_data_info, save_figure,
    plot_indicator_with_recessions, plot_correlation_matrix
)

# Set up the notebook environment
setup_notebook()

# Load data
merged_data = load_data()

# Display information about the dataset
display_data_info(merged_data)

# Plot an indicator with recession periods
fig = plot_indicator_with_recessions(
    merged_data, 
    'UNEMPLOYMENT',
    title='Unemployment Rate with Recession Periods'
)

# Save the figure
save_figure(fig, "unemployment_over_time.png")
```

## Advanced Feature Engineering

For advanced feature engineering, use the functions from the `econ_downturn.features.advanced_engineering` module:

- `engineer_features_with_custom_lags()`: Creates lag variables with custom lag periods
- `create_interaction_terms()`: Creates interaction terms between sentiment and economic indicators
- `apply_sentiment_transformations()`: Applies various transformations to sentiment data
- `select_features()`: Selects the most predictive features

These functions are imported through the `notebook_utils.py` module for convenience.
